 kindly request the creation of a highly functional and feature-rich web calculator that includes the following features:

Basic Arithmetic Functions:

Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
Scientific Functions:

Trigonometric Functions: sin(), cos(), tan(), sec(), cosec(), cot().
Logarithmic Functions: log(), ln() (natural logarithm).
Exponentiation & Roots: x² (square), x³ (cube), x^y (power), √ (square root), ∛ (cube root).
Factorial Calculation: n! for computing factorials such as 5! = 5×4×3×2×1.
Advanced Mathematical Features:

Constants: Pi (π) and Euler’s Number (e).
Modulo operation (%), providing the remainder after division.
Absolute Value function: |x|.
Reciprocal Function: 1/x.

Memory Subtract (M-): Allows subtracting a value from memory.
Memory Recall (MR): Displays the currently stored memory.
Memory Clear (MC): Clears the stored memory.
History & Multi-Step Calculations:

Display of Previous Calculations for user reference.
Support for Multi-Step Expressions: For example, 5 + 3 × 2 = 11 instead of 16.
Undo and Redo options to modify the last entered calculation.
Visual & User Experience Features:

Dark Mode: A toggle for switching between light and dark modes.
Customizable Color Themes for user preferences.
